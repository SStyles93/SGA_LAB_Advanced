# This script is designed to be placed in your Unity project's root folder.
# It automates checking out a specific Git tag and launching the corresponding Unity Editor version.

# --- Configuration (Optional) ---
# If your Unity Hub Editor installations are in a non-standard location, you can uncomment and modify this line:
# UNITY_HUB_EDITORS_PATH="/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor"
# For Windows, this would typically be handled by the PowerShell script.
